"uff, huff"

tap tap tap...

In an alleyway, a man was running for his life, looking back every once in awhile for his pursuer. He looked spent, making one assume had run rather far, and that he was scared of something, something very dreadful.

Yet he couldn’t escape his fate. An iron dagger with black striped hilt, quickly made its way, into the runner’s skull, his temple to be precise, not stopping until it etched itself all the way upto its cross guard.

 The man, with a thud, fell on the filthy ground of the alley with his back facing upwards. his blood abandoning his body.

Unconcerned with the man's final struggle, a figure reached out for the dagger, yanked it out, only to stab the man, now a corpse, again where it’s heart was supposed to be, thoroughly snuffing the man's life out.

Then the figure, garbed in a black hooded robe slipped back into the darkness of the secluded alley.

************************

inside a dark room, sufficiently lit enough to see the necessities but not enough to get a good view, the same figure appeared in front of an iron meshed area of one of the walls.


the figure knocked the wall surrounding the meshed space rather loudly.

“klink, ka-chunk “

A portion of wall behind the mesh opened up, revealing a mysterious figure, covered in darkens.

"peter, he’s dead"

hearing this, the figure behind the layers of walls, quietly noted down something, after he finished he looked up.

"you will receive your payment, as per the  usual methods."

the figure in the hooded robe nodded slightly before asking about his contract.

“so my contract ends here?”

“yes Mr. Kamua. it's been a pleasure”

once again nodding slightly the figure turned back and made it's way forward as the clerk also closed the opening to resume his work.

Walking out of a hotel building, a young in his twenties whispered to himself as felt his bulging coin pouch. This young man who given the name of ‘ray’ had black hair, nascent beard and an overall sharp look to his face. This was the same assassin who earlier killed another for money.

“alright now that I’m finally free what should i do next? South?  There’s the sea so I'll have plenty so food, though they say the air is 'fishy', i think that's quite tolerable if not people wouldn't flock there for no reason, would they?  North maybe? No, although I'm confident in my body, I'm not a fan of cold. "

As his thoughts were all over the place he slowly made his way over to the famous high end restaurant called “Ruchira Fine Dining”, that had always been talk of the town.

"Whatever, first thing's first, I'm gonna fill my belly. Sleep a bit. Then 'relive' myself in that fancy establishment I've heard so much about. "

Thinking this he entered the restaurant and called for the waiter, who arranged his table in a quiet corner with a good view of the street. He got himself a plate of beef Wellington, foie gras, some honey glazed carrots, mashed potatoes, a bowl of mixed sallet and a fine bottle of wine along with an apple tart for desert.

Of course, he usually couldn't afford these as this establishment for focused on the rich and powerful. But since today was the last day he would stay around these parts he might as well give himself a treat.
When all the food disappeared into his stomach, the waiter bought him a napkin, and the bill. "That'll be 5 silvers, sir"

He thought it would cost quite a bit but didn't except the cost to reach 5 silvers. ' wtf that's what? 6% of my savings? '

Taking out the sum and handing over he was wrought by his finance. ' i thought i saved up a pretty good sum for my travels but wtf, did this guy scam me? No, these guys are too rich for that... “
Sigh 
lamenting his finance to himself he made his way to the rented hotel room and slept, waiting for the moon to show itself.

After that he got himself a young lass for 5 silvers. But boy did he last! After indulging in his fantasies he woke up under the warm gaze of the sun.

“I guess that’s it, huh?”

stretching his hand over his head while still in bed ,he started to plan his journey onwards...

****************

at the city gate, they were people and wooden carriages hustling and bustling, the guard warily looking over and checking everyone with their imposing chain mail armour and iron spears.

A little away from the gate and soldiers, there was a caravan pulled by two  horses, moving slowly towards the gate before being stopped by soldiers for investigating.
The soldier who stopped the caravan found five people inside, excluding the man who handled the horses. 

There were four males, one female , young and vigorous ,still with baby fats here and there. She was with a white, blond young man, in his teens, probably the heir to a small business and set off to find their own place in this world after a marriage opposition in family .A classic romance drama story

the other three were all mature men ,with menacing muscles and daggers and spears , with only one with a sword. Ray was also part of this group. He had managed to find himself some travelling company who agreed to take him to the next town for 8 coppers, on  the condition food and everything else will be brought by himself. Ray had no problem with this ,he happily agreed to the  deal as 8 coppers were a good price.

 Depending on the situation the prices can hike up to silvers ,even golds if the path was infested by dangerous monsters of the night. But the kingdom’s soldier would periodically cleanup the major path otherwise merchants and travellers like ray would have to form their own party which is very expense but also dangerous as finding trustworthy companions will prove to be quite difficult.

After getting the green signal by the guards they set off, their destination far,  their day young, with vigilance.

by the time the sun came down, the group had already travelled far.

“keep an eye out for a place to camp,it’s getting late”

the caravan leader ‘jack’ spoke out loud as they passed by many trees with a small clearing underneath. He started to prep a torch with animal fat as he told spoke to the group “once we find a suitable place Ray and bob  will scout around the camp for tracks of animals and edible fruits, I and steve will set up the tents while chloe will prepare food.Any problem with that?” 

seeing that no one had any objections, jack, the only one with a sword   went back to
