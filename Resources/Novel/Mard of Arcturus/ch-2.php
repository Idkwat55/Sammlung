<p>================================================================================</p>

<p></p>

<p>========</p>

<p>by the time the sun came down, the group had already travelled far.</p>

<p>&ldquo;keep an eye out for a place to camp, it&rsquo;s getting late&rdquo;</p>

<p>the caravan leader &lsquo;jack&rsquo; spoke out loud as they passed by many trees with a small clearing underneath. He started to prep a torch with animal fat as he told spoke to the group &ldquo;once we find a suitable place Ray and bob will scout around the camp for tracks of animals and edible fruits, I and Steve will set up the tents while chloe will prepare food. Any problem with that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>seeing that no one had any objections, jack, the only one with a sword went back to preparing .soon they found themselves a pretty good clearing under a big oak tree.</p>

<p>Jack , with a torch in his hand , using the other hand to support himself as he peeked out of the caravan , his sword hanging from his waist belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;alright ,this is it. We won&rsquo;t get anything better than this and we had already wasted enough time for a better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>soon the caravan stopped, the group started to get off and went off towards the tree to make themselves familiar with the area.</p>

<p>Along the way bob, who usually kept to himself , opened his mouth &ldquo;...there would always be a few clearings on this path,especially considering this road connects with the Baghd city. Just our luck he had to come this far to find a oood place to stay the night&rdquo;</p>

<p>As bob said, they had already passed through two good spots but had to give them up because the first already had a group camping there. Though rare ,meeting other traveling groups weren&rsquo;t that uncommon. As for the second spot,it was covered in traces of fight , struggle and blood!. As such the group could only grit them teeth and set off deeper into the road for a spot.</p>

<p>The reason why they were mulling over having to go deeper for a better place wasn&rsquo;t because they were lazy but for the fact there existed a maxim specially fo forest and similar place. &ldquo;The deeper ya venture,the darker ye future&rdquo;.</p>

<p>  ******************</p>

<p> There were old and dead leaves all over ,along with multitude of insects and other small critters. But they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about them too much as the light and smoke of the fire will drive away most of these annoying little pests .</p>

<p> Ray, having just finished a short tour of the area walked back to the tree, where everyone else had already gathered. Chloe had even unload cooking utensils and started to make fire with help of her love, steve. Hearing foot steps to his right he gave a quick glance to find that bob had also returned from his scout. Seeing Ray look over bob raised his head to met his eyes and give a quick nod.</p>

<p>Suddenly his face turned ugly as he faced towards the others. Looking at this ray also focused his attention towards the group only the find that a few dreadful ,nightmarish creatures had quickly surrounded they group.</p>

<p>&ldquo;grrrr&rdquo;</p>

<p>*ROAR! *</p>

<p>In the darkness numrous pairs of devilish ,blood red glistening eyes opened and cloesed chaotically as they fast approached the group like Night Demons.</p>

<p>*clang *</p>

<p>jack quickly unsheathed his sword as he faced those horrifying creatures while yelling &ldquo; Moon wolfs , atleast a dozen&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others had also withdrew their weapons as the braced themselves for the incoming assault .Steve ,with the life of his love at his hands stepped forwards in a defensive position to protect himself and his love with his short sword.But alas he was a educated scholar who only knows to count,read and write.</p>

<p>Those devilish wolfs covered in silver fur covering theirbody like spike while faintly reflecting the emerging moon flew over like lightning shadows as they pounced on jack and steve without mercy.</p>

<p> Unale to keep up with their speeds, steve faltered for but a moment yet that was enough ...</p>

<p>&ldquo;..ugh..&rdquo;</p>

<p>perhaps he was mesmerised by their devilish beauty under the night sky .perhaps it was their bloodlust and hungry growls that caught his mind , but it cost his life...</p>

<p>There is nothing free in this world.Nothing!</p>

<p>The wolf, which met no resistance landed it&rsquo;s unreasonably powerful jaw inliad with canine tooths sharpened by the boned of its last prey , squarely on his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo; arghhh&rdquo;</p>

<p>*crunch * thud</p>

<p>it didn&rsquo;t leave for its nextprey , instead it bid down even deeper , harder while twisted its head finally ripping out ateries,veins, and a big chunk of meat , shoving it down it&rsquo;s throat ferociously as if afraid of competitiors.</p>

<p>A few steps away from this gory scene , chloe ,who had her face smeared with fresh ,warm blood belonging to her one and only took a few seconds , letting the wolf chomp down another fat piece of meat.</p>

<p>A blood curling scream followed, sending shivers down the spine of other gruop members.</p>

<p>&ldquo;AHHhhhh&rdquo;</p>

<p>She quickly turned around , planning to run with her life on the line .But what met her was a warm breath and whisp of foul odor mixed of rotting flesh and blood.</p>

<p>Staring into those glowing ruby like eyes, constrasted by its silver fur with deep dark red dried blood running everywhere from its muzzle ,which bore four big white pearl like canines, two on the top ,two on the bottom ,all while having the turbid strong breath of the wolf blown into her face , she lost it for a moment only to be brought back to reality by the scroching sensation of intense burn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;AHHH!..&rdquo;</p>

<p>She let out a bone chilling scream again as he realised that the wolf had taking a liking to her unsoiled body as it ripped out her entrails , indulging in a bloody feast without a care in the world.</p>

<p> Feeling herself disappearing , being eaten little by little , icnh by inch chloe suddenly looked at Ray. With her bloodshot eyes and gutted ,bloody torso with blood sprinked everywhere ,she looked like a scene right out of a night mare. Opening her mouth which had been sullied by her own blood as she had bitten her lips to endure the hellish pain. She scream like a hungry night wraight &ldquo; HELP..HELP MEE!&rdquo;</p>

<p> Ray ,mesmerised by the scalp numbing scene woke up from his stupor</p>
