About
This Website project started on 9th September when I had little knowledge about CSS. Over time, I've made progress, and now I have a functional website that allows users to upload files and stream videos using PHP. Although I'm still not an expert in these areas, I'm proud to say that I've successfully created a local Git repository and pushed my project to GitHub. In fact, this is my second GitHub repository if we count the previous one, which didn't quite work out as planned. Despite the challenges, I'm excited about my growth and the opportunities that lie ahead for further improvement and learning.

Updates
26 Jul 2023:
I have decided to provide periodic updates to the repository, much like a changelog for an app. At this time, the webpage is finally resembling something that can be called a website - with some animations, JavaScript, Ajax, etc. The key milestones achieved so far are:

Infinite scrolling
Like, dislike, etc. (although not complete)
Target for the Next Update:
Complete the feature handler
Implement commenting functionality
Add "about author" and "about Sammlung" sections
Complete CSS styling
Long-Term Goals:
Optimize website performance
Create a novel page
Obtain a security certificate from Let's Encrypt
Integrate IP info and data collection
Conduct thorough testing
Plan for a beta release
Official project release
