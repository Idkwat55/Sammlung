# Sammlung ( Previously H-indexing , Codename test)

===================== About =================================
This Website project started on 9th September when I had little knowledge about CSS. Over time, I've made progress, and now I have a functional website that allows users to upload files and stream videos using PHP. Although I'm still not an expert in these areas, I'm proud to say that I've successfully created a local Git repository and pushed my project to GitHub. In fact, this is my second GitHub repository if we count the previous one, which didn't quite work out as planned. Despite the challenges, I'm excited about my growth and the opportunities that lie ahead for further improvement and learning.

 I have decided to do these ' Updates ' to the repo, much like a changelog for a app. So at this time the webpage is finally resembling something that can be called a website - with some animation , js, ajax , etc. 
I would say the key milestones here are 
1. Infinite scrolling
2. 2.Like, dislike etc ( though not complete) 

Target for next Update : 
1.Complete the featurehandler
