About
This Website project started on 9th September when I had little knowledge about CSS. Over time, I've made progress, and now I have a functional website that allows users to upload files and stream videos using PHP. Although I'm still not an expert in these areas, I'm proud to say that I've successfully created a local Git repository and pushed my project to GitHub. In fact, this is my second GitHub repository if we count the previous one, which didn't quite work out as planned. Despite the challenges, I'm excited about my growth and the opportunities that lie ahead for further improvement and learning.

26 Jul 2023:
I have decided to provide periodic updates to the repository, much like a changelog for an app. At this time, the webpage is finally resembling something that can be called a website - with some animations, JavaScript, Ajax, etc. The key milestones achieved so far are:

- Infinite scrolling
- Like, dislike, etc. (although not complete)

**Target for the Next Update:**
- Complete the feature handler
- Implement commenting functionality
- Add "about author" and "about Sammlung" sections
- Complete CSS styling
  
**Long-Term Goals:**
- Optimize website performance
- Create a novel page
- Obtain a security certificate from Let's Encrypt
- Integrate IP info and data collection
- Conduct thorough testing
- Plan for a beta release
- Official project release
