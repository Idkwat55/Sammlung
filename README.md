===================== About Me =================================
my website project 
Started in 9th september , when i didn't even know css was a thing to now , where i have a passable, working website with php file uploading and vid streaming. 
i'm still not that good at these stuff but finally managed to successfully create a local git repo and push it to github. 
Infact this is actually my second github repo , if you include the previous one which didn't quite work out.
